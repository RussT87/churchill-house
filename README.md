# Reflection

This reflection aims to provide an insight into the process I took in designing the Churchill House website. It will be broken into three sections; research and design, learning the skills, and developing the site.

The first assessment in this unit required us to look at a range of sites and identify certain elements we found attractive.  I enjoyed this process as it forced me to look deeper into site design than I have in the past. Not only was I searching for websites I liked, I also started to consider the design features of websites I visit regularly and have grown a new appreciation for websites with smart design features. The internet and the web have become such an integral part of life and using them daily means I have taken design features for granted. 

I found learning the skills required to build a site using HTML and CSS enjoyable. It’s a certain type of instant satisfaction when you write some code which you see appear the way you want on your site. I believe a challenge in coding is keeping the information fresh. In learning the skills required to build my site, a difficulty I found is I left too much of a gap between practising the basics of code and implementing them. This meant when I came to building my site, I was forced to go back and re-watch the lectures provided. I then followed along with the lectures and created my actual website. I found once I started developing my site, if I didn’t look at it for a few days it was hard to refocus and meant designing the site became a little like patchwork. I gather once you’ve designed a few sites you would work out a personal preference as to the natural progression of the site. Being my first one though, I believe I jumped around a little and probably wasted a lot of time. 

When developing the site, it became clear that conducting research and creating an inspiration board was extremely useful. I eventually narrowed down my desired look to be based on three sites. I always had these siting in my tabs and constantly referred to them during development. Unfortunately, I only came across the ‘column method’ late in the development stage but feel like this would have helped me, as I wanted to create two columns for the majority of the site. If I was to go back and redesign the site, I would implement this technique. That would also have made the task of converting my site to responsive slightly easier. The converting to responsive I initially found very confusing. I understood the reason behind it but putting it into practice was another story. I had not considered responsive functions at any stage of the process, from research to learning the skills and developing the site. Once again if I was to have my time again this would be a consideration from the start.

# Annotated List

## Websites I gained the most inspiration from:

(https://kubrick.life/)

__Kurbrik Life__ This website made me want to design a one-page website. I liked the large fonts used and basic colours. A full page with white or black and large red writing on it sounds boring but this website is certainly not boring.

(http://pastamansi.com/)

__Pasta Masi__ I liked the two distinct columns used in this website and did my best to recreate that as a defining characteristic.

(https://under.no/)

__Under Restaurant__ The simple colours of this website grabbed me. Combined with the photos it sets a distinct mood. The photos used complement the design style of the site which I also tried to recreate. For this reason I tried to use the drawings and photos with well defined lines that worked with the simple styling of the sites design.

## Websites I used for information:

(https://www.w3schools.com/)

__w3schools__ This site has a great library of examples for both HTML and CSS. The great part about the site is you can read the code but there is also a button you can click on which shows the code being put into practice. 

(https://stackoverflow.com/)

__Stack Overflow__ Here people post issues they are having with trying to achieve certain design styles on their website. Several people often reply with solutions. Reading through the solutions was a good way to increase my knowledge and realise the full potential of HTML and CSS. Though I was very mindful of not picking up bad habits from these boards. I found there are usually several ways to make your design work but not all of them are helpful in the long run.

mmtuts - This is a YouTube channel which I found very useful. The videos cover a range of topics regarding web development and are usually quite easy to follow.

The final appearance of the site has changed a little from my wireframe. The images in the content pages ended up being a lot smaller, leaving more empty space on the page. The header bar was also taken away as I wanted each page to be as simple as possible. The footer I decided to change as well after seeing this site: https://flos.com/. I really liked that the footer took up almost the whole screen. It’s not something you expect and gives a dramatic finish to the site. I also took away the Robin Boyd logo, as it was not appropriate to have the logo as such a dominant part of the site that’s primary function is to promote Churchill House.
